# Microblog App

This is the code for the microblog application course, that is built with Python and the Flask framework. 


## Special thanks Miguel Grinberg!

This project is based on Miguel's [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) that helped me learn about the Flask framework and much more.
